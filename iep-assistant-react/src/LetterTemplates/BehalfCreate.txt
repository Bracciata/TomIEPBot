${user.facultyName},
    I hope this email finds you well! My name is ${user.userName}, I am reaching out to you on
behalf of ${user.childName} who is a student under your supervision. I
am reaching out to you today because I am concerned about ${user.childName}â€™s
performance in your class, and I was hoping that you would be able to assist me potentially in
the process of setting up an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) for them.
    If you are able to assist me in this endeavor, I can be contacted from this email address. I look forward to working with you!
Best regards,
${user.userName}
