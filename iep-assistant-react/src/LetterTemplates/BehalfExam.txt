${user.facultyName},
	I hope this email finds you well! My name is ${user.userName}, I am reaching out to you on behalf of ${user.childName} who is a student under you. Due to ${user.childName}’s performance in class, I was hoping to request a comprehensive educational evaluation of them. This evaluation will help me better understand ${user.childName}’s educational needs, and it will allow me to evaluate whether or not to request an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) for them. 
If you are able to assist me in this endeavor, I am best reached by this email address. I look forward to working with you!
Best regards,
${user.userName}
