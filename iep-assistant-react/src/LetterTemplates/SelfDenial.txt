${user.facultyName},
    Thank you for getting back to me. I am disappointed that you are unable to help me in this regard. As${user.childName} is one of your students, I do request that you send me a written IEP denial for my records. As the parent/guardian of ${user.childName}, my goal is to assist him/her with his/her academic career, and I would like this further documentation in case of future requests.
    Thank you for your time. If you have any questions or concerns with regards to ${user.childName}, please reach out.

Best regards,
${user.userName}
