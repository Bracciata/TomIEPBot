Hello, my name is Tommy brought
Chia and I'm a senior at the

1
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.799
University of nebraska-lincoln.

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.289
I create a table the IEP
assistant for Microsoft Azure

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.299
hack for accessibility 20 21.

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.989
The challenge Tom was built to
solve was build an application

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.789
prototype with as you're born
with people with disabilities

6
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.599
in the context of Education.

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.888
The application should be
functional with real or sample

8
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.199
data.

9
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.489
So Thompson's because he's
built persons with

10
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.289
disabilities by ensuring that
they have an equal right to an

11
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.489
education as the education
system with with Jurassic

12
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.199
Period of change of beginning
of the covid-19 pandemic.

13
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.899
It made it easier for students
with.

14
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.589
These to be left behind so Tom
was built with these students

15
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.889
in mind as I receive feedback
from both students and their

16
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.799
families and the process of
building cam.

17
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.489
For some background and
entomology individualized

18
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.899
education plan.

19
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.599
IEP is a map of the special
services astute requires.

20
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.199
They are to succeed with their
disability as of 2018 or 2019

21
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.499
school year fourteen percent
of all us students had an IEP

22
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.799
as long as schools were still
open during the covid-19

23
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.299
pandemic including remote
learning.

24
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.789
They are and will require to
continue to serve students

25
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.799
with IEPs.

26
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.999
However, many schools struggle
to properly do this.

27
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.288
So that's where Tom comes in
Thomas and is your bought that

28
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.288
was created in order to assist
both students and their

29
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.299
Guardians with creating a new

30
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.199
As well as ensuring that
existing IPS are being followed.

31
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.489
This little fun fact Thomas
named after former, Iowa

32
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.489
Senator Tom Harkin introduced
the individuals with

33
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.788
disabilities Education Act,
which is the bill that covers

34
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.699
IEPs

35
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.189
So how we incorporated how the
inspiration for talking about

36
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.299
and how we incorporate
feedback from the community was

37
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.689
Thomas inspired by my mother
who has to be a special needs

38
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.288
educator editor increase
frustration and concern for

39
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.799
our students as schools failed
to properly follow their IEPs

40
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.599
before and especially as the
covid-19 pandemic started.

41
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.389
So Thompson also supports the
setting up of IDs as one main

42
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.788
challenge that families face
is learning how to begin the

43
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.299
process.

44
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.689
My mother has talked about this
on the numerous occasions with

45
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.699
potential clients.

46
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.489
My mother also be in touch with
some of her clients and their

47
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.599
families to get their feedback
while I was working on top.

48
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.999
With these clients families all
having IEPs for their children

49
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.588
Tom was built with ba composer
framework to deploy in a short

50
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.999
bot.

51
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.088
The bot is accessible from a
crate react to have that is

52
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.889
hosted within as your web app
and Tom utilizes application

53
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.899
and sites for improving
development.

54
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.288
I'm especially excited about
this as we put Tom out to

55
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.999
production

56
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.399
so that we can see 

57
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.789
what the users are putting in
and correct Tom and improve

58
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.099
Tom based on that.

59
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.599
Finally. 

60
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.889
Tom utilizes it language
understanding Louis for

61
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.489
understanding the user
responding to them correctly

62
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.199
during the Or Sation

63
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.599
now, I'm going to show you a
quick demo

64
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.399
in order to begin showcasing
Tom.

65
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.199
I'm going to create an IP on
behalf of another person.

66
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.299
So I'm going to turn my name
first

67
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.399
Tommy. 

68
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.099
I'm reaching out on behalf of
another person.

69
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.299
So the name of the person is
many after my cat.

70
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.499
I'm hoping to create an IEP for
many.

71
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.489
I have not tried to create one
from any before so I start by

72
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.289
reaching out to many Professor
who I'm going to named after

73
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.699
one of the fastest ever UNL

74
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.599
and 

75
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.199
Tom is going to ask for the
preface email.

76
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.189
Then Thomas going to spit out
this link that is going to

77
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.089
open up an email that is
already prefilled with

78
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.999
information

79
00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.199
such as professors email in the
toolbar

80
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.199
or their name right there. 

81
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.989
Minnie's name there and just
kind of a good email to get

82
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.899
the ball rolling on creating
an IEP for many

83
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.199
next. 

84
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.699
I'm going to get an IP and
force on behalf of myself.

85
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.899
So first I'm gonna ask my name 

86
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.899
and I'm reaching out behalf of
myself.

87
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.889
I'd like to get one in fourth I
have in this case tried

88
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.199
reaching out to my professor.

89
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.489
I have not reached out to
somebody else at the school

90
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.499
district level.

91
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.999
So I'm going to name. 

92
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.599
Drop another professor I have
here at UNL.

93
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.199
And then I'm going to enter
their email address.

94
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.189
And once again Tom is going to
create another email that

95
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.289
already has suppressors email
into to line and then it's

96
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.989
going to pre-fill the
information that was given

97
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.199
throughout the email template.

98
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.699
There are many challenges faced
while building Tom the first

99
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.189
and foremost was finding time
to develop Tom while being a

100
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.999
full-time student part-time
entering as well as being

101
00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.989
heavily involved in the
University system as midterms

102
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.899
approach.

103
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.189
Next one challenge that I face
that I would avoid in the

104
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.289
future was I hand coded the
URL create showed that the

105
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.899
react App instead of choosing
to utilize the package.

106
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.299
This was a lesson learned
moment.

107
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.789
Finally trying to follow an
iterative approach in order to

108
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.599
incorporate feedback.

109
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.799
My mom and her clients 

110
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.189
with a limited timeframe and
conflicting schedules was

111
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.299
extremely challenging.

112
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.299
What is expert Tom first and
foremost I would like to add

113
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.699
additional chatbot features

114
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.398
for correcting things such as
soil baby's name or email.

115
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.089
I would also like to add more
questions for Tom to generate

116
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:20.999
a better email.

117
00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:23.899
For example, these may include
why the student needs are has

118
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.699
an IEP the school the student
goes to

119
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.189
and for example the role of the
faculty member if they're not

120
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.399
there Professor.

121
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:31.299
Finally. 

122
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.689
I would like to add a
connection to a list of at

123
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.499
education Advocates and
attorneys

124
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.799
so that they can recommend them
when

125
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.799
they are closed if it's needed. 

126
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.099
Here are some of my sources and
including psychics on my

127
00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.799
interviews.

128
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.489
I just like to thank you for
taking time out of your day to

129
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.299
judge the saxophone.
