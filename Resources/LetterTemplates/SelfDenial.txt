${user.facultyName},
    Thank you for getting back to me. I am disappointed that you are unable to help me in setting up an IEP. As I am one of your students, I do request that you send me a written IEP denial for my records. My goal is to assist my academic career, and I would like this further documentation in case of future requests.
    Thank you for your time. If you have any questions or concerns with regards to myself, please reach out.

Best regards,
